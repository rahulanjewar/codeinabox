1. For importiing dataset I used Pandas library.

2. Imported training dataset in a pandas dataframe.

3. Checked for any null values inside the dataframe. Observed that no null values were present so we can proceed with current frame without any modifications.

4. Visualised the heatmap of the correlation data of the training dataset to find any potential useless data column. Observed that almost all columns had same correlation value. So I decided not to drop any column from the table

5. Split the training dataset into input(x_train) and output(y_train).

6. Imported SKlearn module for creating the ML model.

7. Decided to use Decision Tree approach for the model.

8. Created the DecisionTreeClassifier and loaded the training dataset into it.

9. imported testing dataset into another pandas dataframe.

10. Repeated step 3 for testing dataset as well.

11. Used model predict method of decision tree classsifier to predict output for testing data.
